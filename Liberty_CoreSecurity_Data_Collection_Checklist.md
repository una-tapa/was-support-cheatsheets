<summary><b>3Ô∏è‚É£ Gather Liberty Data to Send to IBM Support</b></summary>

**Generate dump ZIP (logs + configs):**

- **Windows**
  ```
  <LIBERTY_HOME>\bin\server.bat dump <serverName>
  ```
- **UNIX/Linux**
  ```
  <LIBERTY_HOME>/bin/server dump <serverName>
  ```

The resulting file (for example:  
`myserver.dump-17.03.20_22.20.57.zip`) will be created under:
```
<LIBERTY_HOME>/usr/servers/<serverName>/
```

**Also collect:**
```
<JAVA_HOME>/lib/security/java.security
```

‚úÖ Ensure the trace covers the timeframe of the issue.

When ready, send the `.zip` and supplemental information following  
**‚ÄúExchanging information with IBM Technical Support for problem determination.‚Äù**
